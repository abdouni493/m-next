## 💡 Key Features Explained

### 1. Auto-Price Calculation
```
Scenario 1: User enters buying price + margin %
→ Selling price auto-calculates
Formula: selling_price = buying_price × (1 + margin/100)

Scenario 2: User enters buying price + selling price
→ Margin % auto-calculates
Formula: margin = ((selling_price - buying_price) / buying_price) × 100

Scenario 3: User edits only buying price
→ Both margin % and selling price recalculate
```

### 2. Payment Summary
```
Total Price = Buying Price × Initial Quantity
Amount Paid = User enters amount
Remaining = Total Price - Amount Paid

If Remaining > 0 → Mark as Debt ✓
If Remaining = 0 → Fully Paid ✓
```

### 3. Inline Item Creation
```
When user clicks ➕ button:
1. Dialog appears over current content
2. User fills in details
3. Clicks Save
4. Item auto-adds to dropdown
5. User can immediately select it
6. No page refresh needed
```

### 4. Bilingual Support
```
Arabic (ar): Full right-to-left support
French (fr): Standard left-to-right
300+ strings translated
Currency formatted per language
Easy to extend to other languages
```
